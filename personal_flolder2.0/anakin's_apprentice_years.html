                <p>Anakin Skywalker was primarily trained by two Jedi during his time as an apprentice: Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Qui-Gon Jinn discovered Anakin on Tatooine in "Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace." He recognized Anakin's exceptional potential in the Force and believed he could be the Chosen One who would bring balance to the Force. However, Qui-Gon was killed by Darth Maul before he could fully train Anakin. Following Qui-Gon's death, Obi-Wan Kenobi took on the responsibility of training Anakin. Initially hesitant due to the Jedi Council's concerns about Anakin's age and emotional attachments, Obi-Wan eventually became Anakin's Jedi Master and mentor. The two formed a close bond, and Obi-Wan played a significant role in shaping Anakin's Jedi training and worldview. Under Obi-Wan's guidance, Anakin learned various Jedi skills, lightsaber combat, and the ways of the Force. However, Anakin's struggles with his emotions, attachments, and conflicts ultimately led to his fall to the dark side, transitioning into Darth Vader under the influence of Darth Sidious (Emperor Palpatine).</p>
